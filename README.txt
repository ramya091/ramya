Niran Matrimony — Website package
Files included:
- index.html  (main landing page with profile form)
- terms.html  (terms & privacy)
- logo.png    (logo created for your site)
- banner.png  (banner / hero image)

How submissions work:
1) User fills the short profile form and clicks "Submit & Open WhatsApp".
2) The site opens WhatsApp with a prefilled message to your number (+91 93453 86861).
3) The submission is also saved in the browser session and you can download all submissions as a CSV by clicking "Download CSV".
4) For automatic saving to Google Sheets or Airtable, contact me and I will provide a Zapier/Make recipe (may require account).

Notes on changing number:
- To change WhatsApp number update the 'waNumber' value inside index.html script to your new number in international format, e.g. '919876543210'.

WhatsApp auto-reply suggestions:
- Using WhatsApp Business App: Go to Settings -> Business tools -> Away message / Greeting message and set a greeting like:
  "Hi! Thanks for contacting Niran Matrimony. Please share: Name | Age | Gender | District | Education. We'll respond shortly."
- For automated two-way bot or direct saving to Google Sheets, use providers like 360dialog, WATI or Twilio (I can help set up).

If you want me to deploy this to Google Sites or Netlify and connect Google Sheets automatically, reply and I will do it for you.
